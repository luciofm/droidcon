If I Can, You Can Too - Animations for Developers...

I recoment running this on a Lollypop Emulator (Nexus 7 configuration) or on a Nexus 7 with Lollypop...

The layouts are not "responsive" so I REALLY recommend using a new Nexus 7 (or the Emulator) to run this...

It will crash if not run on Lollypop...

Thanks for eveyone that came to the Talk...
